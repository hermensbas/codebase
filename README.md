# Codebase
A collection of all my scripts as I create them. This includes, but is not limited to, languages such as Bash, Powershell, C++, C#, LUA, PHP and SQL.

Whenever I decide I want to create something that helps me in automation of services or just for the fun of it, I will be adding them here to easily keep track of what I'm doing. The scripts are not made with the public in mind and may not suit you, but is free to use.

I am not experienced enough in a specific language to call myself a professional, most of the time I learn enough to create what I need at the time. I will rewrite parts, or an entire script, if I find a better way of doing it.
