# AzerothCore
This is the content I use with my World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King (3.3.5a) server. The core I use is [AzerothCore](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk).

The following features are currently included with these scripts:
1. The in-game command .assistant brings up a gossip menu that can give the player equipment, heirlooms, glyphs, gems, containers and utilities.
2. Multiply the experience and reputation rate based on the players level and also increase it more on weekends.
3. Give the player a reward of gold when reaching specific levels.
4. Set the spawn point of new characters.
5. Give the player all spells and talent ranks specific to their class when leveling up. It works much like the system in later version of World of Warcraft.

The file located in the gallery directory is a script I don't use myself but created for someone on the [AzerothCore](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk) Discord server.

**These scripts require the Eluna module.**
