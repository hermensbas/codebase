# Interfaced
This addon moves the player and target frames to be closer to the center of the screen. It gives the option to hide and show enabled bars from the Bartender addon using a simple keybind. It moves the castbar to be underneath the player frame and recudes it's size dramatically. It will hide the dragons on the sides of the default action bars.

# Jamba
Removed the header for DisplayTeam and changed the spaces used to allow it to be smaller without it looking odd. Ported the Currency module from the newer version of Jamba to this version.

# VudDo
Disabled the information and warnings produces when using the BuffWatch. It will, for example, no longer print **No buff to cast**.
