# Area Accessor
Adds a npc in every starting area that gives players the ability to teleport to other starting areas so they can choose where they want to start leveling or teleport to their friends to level together.

# Dungeon Quests
Adds a npc in almost every dungeon that offers players quests related to that dungeon. It does this by making a copy of the original quest for that dungeon but slightly modified to fit with the new npc. It disables quests it has replaced so the same one can't be completed more than once. This script is a work in progress.

# Emblem Drop
Adds Emblem of Conquest to every normal dungeon boss, the final boss will always drop two, to help the players that recently reached max level get started.

# Free Reagents
Makes the reagents for various area of effect buffs free of charge as well as regular arrows and bullets.

# Game Tele
Adds teleports to two odd locations. Nothing to pay attention to, it's mainly here in case I need those locations.

# Heirloom Hoarder
Adds spawn points for the Heirloom Hoarder feature of the [Account Bound](https://github.com/tkn963/mod-accountbound) module to every starting area.

# Support Items
Adds a npc, originally in Dalaran by the fountain, that will sell the player certain reagents for professions. These are currently enchanting rods, normally created by blacksmiths, and vellums which is needed by enchanters.
