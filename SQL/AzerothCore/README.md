# AzerothCore
This is the content I use with my World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King (3.3.5a) server. The core I use is [AzerothCore](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk).

1. The file emblem_drops.sql makes all normal dungeon bosses drop Emblem of Conquest.
2. The file mod_assistant.sql spawns the npc from the assistant module in Stormwind City, Orgrimmar and Dalaran.
3. The file quest_loot.sql makes all quest-related items that drop from creatures drop for all members of a group.

# Credit
All respect goes to the amazing people developing the core for us to use.

Anyone is free to use this content for themselves or on a public server, but do not take credit for the code.
